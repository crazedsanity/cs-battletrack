## Web Application Code Moved

The code for the web application is being moved to a private repository.  This will continue to be the location of the backend libraries, but the frontend code has been moved elsewhere... at least for now.

## What is This?

This is the home for TTORP.  Check it out... [ http://www.crazedsanity.com/blog/slaughter/ttorp ]

Current Features:
 * Character sheets
 * Campaigns

Items Planned for Future Releases:
 * chat
 * map-based movements
 * round-based battle tracking: hit points, character status, etc.

## Character Sheets

Character sheets currently are HTML-based.  The page is updated dynamically via AJAX, and the page will highlight all attributes that have changed as a result.
